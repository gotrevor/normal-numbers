# PENDING WORK — B5′ campaign (updated 2026-08-23, post-W3)

**W3 ✅ COMPLETE** (2026-08-23, 8 laps): all four frozen `CFMixing.lean`
statements proved, axiom-clean — `measurePreserving_gaussMap` (B1),
`volume_inter_preimage_eq_integral`, `cylinder_mixing` (C = 8 log 2,
ρ = 9/10, geometric — escape valve unused), `gauss_kuzmin` (B4).
`src/` is sorry-free.  See `HANDOFF-2026-08-23-2040.md`.

**W4 groundwork STARTED (this lap)**: `CFGammaMixing.lean` proves the
KPW-Lemma-6 substitute — the W4 correlation-decay engine — axiom-clean:

- `setIntegral_inter_preimage`: the s-started conditional density
  identity `∫_{I_w ∩ T^{-|w|}B} h_s = (∫_B h_{tChain s w})·(∫_{I_w} h_s)`
  (generalizes aux from `h_0 = 1` to any `h_s`, s ∈ [0,1]).
- `gaussMeasure_cylinder_mixing` (**γ-mixing, geometric rate**):
  `|γ(I_v ∩ T^{-(|v|+g)}A) − γ(I_v)γ(A)| ≤ (9/10)^g·4|A|·γ(I_v)`.
  Route: mixture Fubini γ = ∫₀¹ h_s·Leb dλ(s) + the pin bound, which is
  uniform in the start t — no new analysis was needed.

**W4 remaining** (statement freezing is JUDGE-owned; lap-legal work is
intermediate lemmas + drafts):
1. Block-frequency variance: for a digit word v, S_n = #{j < n :
   T^j x ∈ I_v}; E_γ and Var_γ from γ-mixing (pair terms j, j' need
   the gap ≥ |v| case from `gaussMeasure_cylinder_mixing` at base word
   v; overlapping pairs (|j−j'| < |v|) bounded crudely by n·|v|·γ(I_v)).
   Chebyshev ⇒ γ{|S_n/n − γ(I_v)| > δ} ≤ K/(δ²n).
2. Conditioned version on a base cylinder I_w (B–Y need per-stage bad
   measure < ¼ *given the current brick*): same computation under the
   conditional measure — the s-started identity makes every conditional
   a tailDensity mixture, so the same pin applies.  Alternatively work
   with Leb-conditionals directly via `volume_inter_preimage_horizon`.
3. b-ary side: Lemma 8 (Hardy–Wright Thm 148 Chernoff block counting)
   + Lemma 9 (BHS 3.1 concatenation) — check overlap with
   `Counting.lean`/`Visits.lean` first.
4. DRAFT frozen W4 statements for judge ratification (do NOT put
   unratified "frozen" statements in a scaffold file claiming authority;
   put proposals in drafts/).

**Judge attention requested**: ratify W4 statement shapes; note the
γ-mixing bonus (stronger than the planned Leb-only route: it is exact
γ-correlation decay, geometric, multiplicative in γ(I_v)).
