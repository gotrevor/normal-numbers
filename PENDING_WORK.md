# PENDING WORK — the queue

Concrete next moves, cheapest and most clear-cut first.  Front context is in `STATUS.md`.  The
lap-by-lap log from before the 2026-09-27 merge is `archive/PENDING_WORK-to-2026-09-27.md`.
Treadmill laps append dated notes **below the queue**, and a review lap folds them back into it.

## Queue

1. **Vandehey crux `vandeheyUniformFreq_holds`.**
   - First evaluate the Smith-normal-form shortcut: `GL₂(ℤ)` maps, where CF tails agree
     (Serret), plus `x ↦ Dx` for prime `D`, which the class automaton already covers.
   - Otherwise, follow the NEXT list in `archive/handoff/HANDOFF-2026-09-28-vandehey-bridge-CLOSED.md`.
2. **Joint Lambert, unconditional.**  Discharge `AGP` and `PrimeIntervalSupply` from PNT+
   (`WeakPNT_AP`, PNT).  After that, the quantitative §6 count is a separate target.
3. **C3/MRT `CharTailCancellation`.**  This is the only C3 input with a standard-literature proof:
   Euler product, then `L(1,χ) ≫ q^{-1/2}`, then arg-L winding.
4. **Elliott margin check.**  A Littlewood-strength `ζ'/ζ ≪ log t / log log t` would suffice if
   every consumer in `ElliottZetaTheta.lean` tolerates a `log log log` margin.  Check that.  If
   one doesn't, record "Vinogradov or nothing" in the Maze.
5. **SwingC2 triage.**  Delete or restate `tauMomentPrimesShiftStruct_of_primeDensity`, which
   takes the vacuous `PrimeDensityAP`, and `survivorLeaf_of_struct`.

## Lap notes (newest first)

### 2026-09-28 — OPERATOR OBJECTIVE items 1-3, all three landed

1. **`moshchevitinShkredov_cf_false` PROVED** (`MoshchevitinShkredovRefuted.lean`, wired into
   the root import).  Witness `x = [0;1,2,3,…]` from `exists_irrational_mem_iInter_cfCylinder`
   on the nested words `[1,…,s+1]`; `exists_irrational_cfDigit_succ` is the reusable form.
   Strictly increasing digits ⇒ the first letter of a genuine block pins its unique start
   position ⇒ every block occurs at most once ⇒ every frequency is `O(1/p)`, so the criterion's
   hypothesis is vacuous at `σ = 0` while `γ(I_1) = log₂(4/3) > 0`.  Maze:
   `hall_moshchevitin_shkredov_cf_false`.
2. **`conjC3_of_geom_input_band'`** (`C3MrtBlockDefect.lean`) is the C3 headline with `hURM`
   discharged by `uniformResonantMass_holds`.  `C3MrtURMLowHigh.lean` retired as the redundant
   second route: its sorried narrow high range `|t| < 2δ` had no consumer and is removed; its
   sorry-free lemmas stay.  Maze: `hall_urm_low_high_split`.
3. **`exists_jointFreq_limit` retired.**  Its `Synchronizing` hypothesis is unsatisfiable, and
   that is now a THEOREM, not just a probe: `not_synchronizing_of_injective_quotient` — an
   automaton with a quotient on which every letter acts injectively has no synchronizing word.
   For the det-`±D` transducer the quotient is the row-lattice class in `ℙ¹(ℤ/D)` and each
   `B_a ∈ GL₂(ℤ/D)`.  Axiom-free.  Maze: `hall_vandehey_synchronizing_transducer`.  The live
   transfer principle is `VandeheyCocycle.tendsto_jointCount_of_classEquidistribution`, whose
   hypothesis `ClassEquidistribution` is now the single crux of the Vandehey front.
