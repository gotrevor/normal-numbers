# DIRECTION — normal-numbers 🧭

**No active objective.**  The next run takes its objective from the operator: a kickoff file,
plus a dated section at the top of this file that names the target theorem and the stop
condition.  Open fronts: `STATUS.md`.  Queue: `PENDING_WORK.md`.

Completed runs (the directive text is in git history, the outcome in `STATUS.md`):
- 2026-09-28 (a): Moshchevitin–Shkredov refuted; C3 headline without `hURM`; Vandehey automaton
  hypothesis refuted.
- 2026-09-28 (b)+(c): **Vandehey 2017 Thm 1.1 proved** (`vandehey_matrix_action_holds`, `6d7a8ad`).
- 2026-09-28 (joint Lambert inputs): `PrimeIntervalSupply` proved (`3ddc0b6`); AGP gap mapped
  (`docs/JOINT-LAMBERT-AGP-GAP.md`).

The pre-merge directive history is in `archive/DIRECTION-to-2026-09-27.md`.

## Standing rules (bind every lap)

1. **Guard rule.**  A lap may not hand the chain a new `Prop` unless the same lap also lands, in
   the kernel:
   - a *content locator*: the trivial or extremal instance, which shows where the content is not;
   - a *degenerate-case verdict* for the empty, singleton, truncated/boundary and
     constant-function configurations.
   A reduction without both is not an advance.  This rule was installed at C3/MRT lap 115, after
   laps 112-114 "reduced" the debt to statements that were false: a stronger statement looks
   cleaner and dies on a singleton block.
2. **Refutations are progress, and are recorded as Lean data.**  Every walked dead end gets a row
   in `src/NormalNumbers/Maze.lean`, aliased onto the refuting theorem.  Read the Maze before
   proposing a route.
3. **Literature inputs are named hypothesis `Prop`s**: cited, faithful or weaker, never `axiom`.
   Proving one is a side quest in its own right (Philipp and Wall were proved this way).
4. **Frozen statements stay byte-identical.**  A campaign's ratified headline and its frozen
   modules are pinned by commit in that campaign's kickoff.  Statement freezing is JUDGE-owned
   (`JUDGE.md`).
5. **A false contract is recorded as an obstruction, never silently weakened.**
6. **Every new module goes in the root import** (`src/NormalNumbers.lean`), so `lake build`
   covers it.

## Standing charter (destination)

The project harvests the digit-reading dynamics of real numbers: normality, disjunctivity,
continued-fraction normality, and the richness of arithmetic constants such as `∑ ω(n)/bⁿ`.
Moonshot lane: aim at the open conjectures (C1-C3 of the casting-out programme, Vandehey's
open problem), and treat a conditional theorem on an honestly labelled literature input as a
real advance.
