# DIRECTION — normal-numbers 🧭

## CURRENT DIRECTIVE (altitude laps only write here; it OUTRANKS the HANDOFF) 🧭

**Set 2026-09-29 (review lap 27).**

* **Objective.**  Vandehey §7 Problem 1, at the crux: `SampledUniformCount q r₀ ℓ`.  Nothing
  else on this front counts as progress.
* **Mandated next move — the ERGODIC route is now primary.**  `VandeheyS7Orbit.affineCFN_of_orbitACBound`
  proves the frozen target from a ONE-SIDED bound `OrbitACBound q r₀ C`
  (`#{j<p : Gʲz ∈ (a,b)}/p ≤ C(b−a)+ε`) plus the cited `GaussACRigidity C`.  No `x`-independent
  limit anywhere; the value is forced to be γ.  Work it in this order:
  (i) **discharge `GaussACRigidity`** — ergodicity of `gaussMap` for γ from
  `Literature.philipp_psi_mixing_holds` + `gaussMeasure_preimage`, then uniqueness of the a.c.
  invariant probability (mathlib's `MeasurePreserving.rnDeriv_comp_aeEq`), then Krylov–Bogolyubov
  on the compact `[0,1]` (mathlib's Prokhorov `CompactSpace (ProbabilityMeasure E)`);
  (ii) **attack `OrbitACBound`** with the distortion/merging layer already proved.
  The state-indexed decomposition below stays the FALLBACK, not the first move.
* **Forbidden drift.**  Do **not** try to make the image digit a function of a bounded input
  window.  `VandeheyS7Memory.no_window_function` refutes it in the kernel for every window and
  every window length, with witnesses of minimal distortion, and it is
  `hall_emit_digit_window_function` / `hall_vandehey_synchronizing_transducer` in the Maze.
  Do not use `spread_runWord_le` as "initial-state independence": it bounds the image DIAMETER,
  never its LOCATION.  Do not hand the chain a bounded-error decomposition
  (`cfCount_tendsto_of_decomposition`): the exceptional set has positive Gauss mass, so the
  error is `Θ(p)`; use the ε-scheme.
* **Why.**  Laps 11–26 proved every analytic input (merging, window bound, digit transfer,
  budget) and then framed the remainder as bookkeeping against a window function.  That frame
  is false, and it is a hall the build had already closed a lap earlier.  The state is a genuine
  hidden variable; replacing Vandehey's finite state set by a measure on a compact fiber is the
  whole content of Route A, and it must be *stated* before it can be attacked.

Directive history:
- 2026-09-29 (lap 27, review): window-function frame REFUTED; ε-scheme replaces the bounded-error
  engine; the ERGODIC route (`OrbitACBound` + `GaussACRigidity`) becomes primary, the
  state-indexed decomposition the fallback.


## OPERATOR OBJECTIVE 2026-09-29: Vandehey §7 Problem 1 🌙

**Target (open, Vandehey Compositio 2017 §7 Problem 1):** if `x` is CF-normal, is `φx` CF-normal?
Is `x + φ`?  Moonshot lane: the objective is a conjecture graph, not "prove X".  There is no
stop condition beyond the lap cap; a refutation of a route is an advance, and a lap succeeds by
advancing the crux, not by sorry count.

**Read first:** `papers/vandehey-2017-open-problem-attack-map.md` (§1 diagnosis, §2 dead ends,
§3 Route A with the three 2026-08-24 corrections), `experiments/PROBE-ROUTE-A.md`,
`archive/probe/PROBE-2026-08-25-1235-route-a-transducer.md`, and the Maze.  Serret/commensurator
and soft rigidity (self-joinings of geodesic flow) are dead; do not relitigate them.

**Graph to build:**
1. **Frozen targets.**  A new module `VandeheyS7.lean` (in the root import) stating
   `vandeheyS7_mul_phi : ∀ x, IsCFNormal (Int.fract x) → IsCFNormal (Int.fract (goldenRatio * x))`
   and `vandeheyS7_add_phi` (for `x + φ`), plus the general quadratic-irrational form as a Prop.
   These are open statements: `sorry`-free is not expected, and they are never weakened.
   Record the frozen names and commit in `HANDOFF.md`.
2. **The obstruction, as Lean.**  The Thm 1.1 pipeline (Raney normal form → transducer → class
   equidistribution → run clock, `VandeheyCapstone.lean`) needs a finite state set.  State as
   Props, with probes, where it breaks over `ℤ[φ]`: unit drift makes the reachable state set
   infinite; pathwise merging is impossible (`M⁻¹VM` integral forces `V` diagonal for
   `M = diag(φ,1)`); Lemma 2.2's bounded burst fails (`burst ≤ C + log(1+a)/Lévy` instead).
   Prove what is provable (infinitude of the state set, the non-merging fact) and add Maze rows.
3. **Route A: replace finiteness.**  The dynamics read only the real place.  Candidate nodes:
   a bounded-distortion window lemma for reduced post-emission states (the compact analogue of
   `entries ≤ D`; the integer descent does NOT port), a distributional merging statement
   (Birkhoff–Hopf cone contraction, not coupling), trigger windows with `ρ(∂U) = 0` in place of
   trigger strings, and the endgame either-or trick (verbatim for any `M`, so the problem reduces
   to "every string has a limiting frequency in `φx`, independent of the CF-normal `x`").  Wire
   each node to the frozen target by a theorem, even a conditional one.
4. **Reuse before rebuild.**  Factor the Thm 1.1 pipeline so its finite-state step is a named
   hypothesis; the new work supplies a compact-fiber substitute for that hypothesis.

Guard rule applies to every new Prop (content locator + degenerate cases).  A Prop that turns
out false goes in the Maze with its refutation, never silently weakened.

**Lap 1 side items (cheap, do first):** SwingC2 triage and the OVERVIEW refresh (Vandehey 1.1
proved, joint Lambert rests on AGP alone) from `PENDING_WORK.md`; prune them from the queue when
done.

Open fronts: `STATUS.md`.  Queue: `PENDING_WORK.md`.

Completed runs (the directive text is in git history, the outcome in `STATUS.md`):
- 2026-09-28 (a): Moshchevitin–Shkredov refuted; C3 headline without `hURM`; Vandehey automaton
  hypothesis refuted.
- 2026-09-28 (b)+(c): **Vandehey 2017 Thm 1.1 proved** (`vandehey_matrix_action_holds`, `6d7a8ad`).
- 2026-09-28 (joint Lambert inputs): `PrimeIntervalSupply` proved (`3ddc0b6`); AGP gap mapped
  (`docs/JOINT-LAMBERT-AGP-GAP.md`).

The pre-merge directive history is in `archive/DIRECTION-to-2026-09-27.md`.

## Standing rules (bind every lap)

1. **Guard rule.**  A lap may not hand the chain a new `Prop` unless the same lap also lands, in
   the kernel:
   - a *content locator*: the trivial or extremal instance, which shows where the content is not;
   - a *degenerate-case verdict* for the empty, singleton, truncated/boundary and
     constant-function configurations.
   A reduction without both is not an advance.  This rule was installed at C3/MRT lap 115, after
   laps 112-114 "reduced" the debt to statements that were false: a stronger statement looks
   cleaner and dies on a singleton block.
2. **Refutations are progress, and are recorded as Lean data.**  Every walked dead end gets a row
   in `src/NormalNumbers/Maze.lean`, aliased onto the refuting theorem.  Read the Maze before
   proposing a route.
3. **Literature inputs are named hypothesis `Prop`s**: cited, faithful or weaker, never `axiom`.
   **New math comes first.**  A literature input stays assumed until a new result needs it
   discharged; then proving it is a side quest (Philipp and Wall were proved this way).
4. **Frozen statements stay byte-identical.**  A campaign's ratified headline and its frozen
   modules are pinned by commit in that campaign's kickoff.  Statement freezing is JUDGE-owned
   (`JUDGE.md`).
5. **A false contract is recorded as an obstruction, never silently weakened.**
6. **Every new module goes in the root import** (`src/NormalNumbers.lean`), so `lake build`
   covers it.

## Standing charter (destination)

The project harvests the digit-reading dynamics of real numbers: normality, disjunctivity,
continued-fraction normality, and the richness of arithmetic constants such as `∑ ω(n)/bⁿ`.
Moonshot lane: aim at the open conjectures (C1-C3 of the casting-out programme, Vandehey's
open problem), and treat a conditional theorem on an honestly labelled literature input as a
real advance.
